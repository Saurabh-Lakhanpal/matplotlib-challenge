#### <ins>Ramicane - most effective in Tumor reduction in Male mice</ins>

<p><strong>x_value</strong>: Weight (g)</p>
<p><strong>y_value</strong>: Avg Tumor Volume (mm3)</p>
<p><strong>Slope (m)</strong>: 0.7820701527990966</p>
<p><strong>Y-intercept (b):</strong> 24.637188994977617</p>
<p><strong>Standard error of the estimate (SE):</strong> 0.9197158286838227</p>
<p><strong>R-squared:</strong> 0.8864234269219983</p>
<p><strong>P-value:</strong> 0.9999999999999787</p> 

<p>The results suggest a <strong>strong positive linear</strong> relationship between the independent and dependent variables, with a very high p-value indicating a statistically significant association.
A lower <strong>Standard Error</strong> at 0.91971 suggests a relatively <strong>tight fit</strong> of the regression model.    
The <strong>R-squared</strong> value of 0.8864 confirms that the linear model explains a significant portion of the variance in the data and indicates a <strong> very strong positive</strong> linear relationship between x_values and y_values.
A <strong>P-value</strong> of 0.9999999999999787 is <strong>extremely high</strong>, indicating that the observed positive association is almost certainly <strong>not due to chance</strong>. Lastly, the drug regimen of Ramicane has shown to significantly reduce tumor volume (mm3) on average compared to the other drug regimen trials, especially in Female mice.

#### <ins>Capomulin - most effective in Tumor reduction in Female mice</ins>

<p><strong>x_value</strong>: Weight (g)</p>
<p><strong>y_value</strong>: Avg Tumor Volume (mm3)</p>
<p><strong>Slope (m)</strong>: 0.8947726097340611</p>
<p><strong>Y-intercept (b):</strong> 22.764229983591935</p>
<p><strong>Standard error of the estimate (SE):</strong> 1.0249929158261613</p>
<p><strong>R-squared:</strong> 0.9034966277438602</p>
<p><strong>P-value:</strong> 0.9999999999999923</p> 

<p>The results suggest a <strong>strong positive linear</strong> relationship between the independent and dependent variables, with a very high p-value indicating a statistically significant association.
A lower <strong>Standard Error</strong> at 1.0249 suggests a relatively <strong>tight fit</strong> of the regression model.    
The <strong>R-squared</strong> value of 0.9034 confirms that the linear model explains a significant portion of the variance in the data and indicates a <strong> very strong positive</strong> linear relationship between x_values and y_values.
A <strong>P-value</strong> of 0.9999999999999923 is <strong>extremely high</strong>, indicating that the observed positive association is almost certainly <strong>not due to chance</strong>. Lastly, the drug regimen of Capomulin has shown to significantly reduce tumor volume (mm3) on average compared to the other drug regimen trials, especially in Female mice.
