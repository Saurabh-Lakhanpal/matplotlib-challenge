### Both Capomulin and Ramicane Drug Regimens show effectiveness to reduces the Tumor volume in comparison to the other Drug Regimens. We also see a correlation between the tumor size and the weight of the mice, a bigger sample and further study comparing the weight groups with average reduction in tumor volume will help us understand the effectiveness of these Drug Regimens and select the best one.

### <ins>Capomulin</ins>

<p><strong>x_value</strong>: Weight (g)</p>
<p><strong>y_value</strong>: Avg Tumor Volume (mm3)</p>
<p><strong>Slope (m)</strong>: 0.9544396890241048</p>
<p><strong>Y-intercept (b):</strong> 21.552160532685</p>
<p><strong>Standard error of the estimate (SE):</strong> 1.788523170768337</p>
<p><strong>R-squared:</strong> 0.7088568047708719</p>
<p><strong>P-value:</strong> 0.999999999999975</p> 

<p>The results suggest a <strong>strong positive linear</strong> relationship between the independent and dependent variables, with a very high p-value indicating a statistically significant association.
A lower <strong>Standard Error</strong> at 1.7885 suggests a relatively <strong>tight fit</strong> of the regression model.    
The <strong>R-squared</strong> value of 0.7088 confirms that the linear model explains a significant portion of the variance in the data and indicates a <strong> very strong positive</strong> linear relationship between x_values and y_values.
A <strong>P-value</strong> of 0.999999999999975 is <strong>extremely high</strong>, indicating that the observed positive association is almost certainly <strong>not due to chance</strong>. Lastly, the drug regimen of Capomulin has shown to significantly reduce tumor volume (mm3) on average compared to the other drug regimen trials, especially in Female mice.

### <ins>Ramicane</ins>

<p><strong>x_value</strong>: Weight (g)</p>
<p><strong>y_value</strong>: Avg Tumor Volume (mm3)</p>
<p><strong>Slope (m)</strong>: 0.769624787847222</p>
<p><strong>Y-intercept (b):</strong> 25.163491795256977</p>
<p><strong>Standard error of the estimate (SE):</strong> 1.9363125781360453</p>
<p><strong>R-squared:</strong> 0.6496844667454373</p>
<p><strong>P-value:</strong> 0.9999999999999751</p> 

<p>The results suggest a <strong>strong positive linear</strong> relationship between the independent and dependent variables, with a very high p-value indicating a statistically significant association.
A lower <strong>Standard Error</strong> at 1.9363 suggests a relatively <strong>tight fit</strong> of the regression model.    
The <strong>R-squared</strong> value of 0.6496 confirms that the linear model explains a significant portion of the variance in the data and indicates a <strong> very strong positive</strong> linear relationship between x_values and y_values.
A <strong>P-value</strong> of 0.9999999999999751 is <strong>extremely high</strong>, indicating that the observed positive association is almost certainly <strong>not due to chance</strong>. Lastly, the drug regimen of Capomulin has shown to significantly reduce tumor volume (mm3) on average compared to the other drug regimen trials, especially in Female mice.
